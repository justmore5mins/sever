execute as @p run say If you play on this mode, you'll run through this whole map! There are 340 stages *BUT* some stages have "secrets" or shortcuts in them that allow you to skip over large amounts of levels, so keep a lookout for them!!! The levels won't be shuffled either, due to command restraints. They will be played in the same order every time. Speedrun at your own risk! In singleplayer, the game ends either when you finish all levels or if you end it w/ the firework. In multiplayer, the first person to play all levels will 'win' but the game won't end until all players finish (or vote to end). Another player will earn a 'win' based on most levels completed including skips. NOTE THAT THIS MAY TAKE WELL OVER 2-3 HOURS, SO PLAN TO HAVE SOME FREE TIME IF YOU DO THIS!!!!! Keep an eye on the timer up top. If you enable skips, you're only allowed 30 levels to skip. At the end, all levels skipped and time ran outs will be removed from your score, even though they may go up during the game. Stages that say are worth multiple points won't actually be worth multiple points.
